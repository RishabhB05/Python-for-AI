Why you need Git
As an AI engineer, you’ll use Git to:
Save your progress: Never lose code again
Try experiments: Test ideas without breaking working code
Share projects: Show your work to employers or collaborators
Use AI tools: Many AI projects are shared on GitHub





Version control:- it helps in reverse the changes in code of by changing the version

Example:------>
# Monday: Your code works
def calculate_price(amount):
    return amount * 1.20  # 20% markup

# Tuesday: Boss wants 25% markup
def calculate_price(amount):
    return amount * 1.25  # Changed from 20% to 25%

# Wednesday: "Actually, can we go back to 20%?"
# With Git: Easy! Just go back to Monday's version
# Without Git: Hope you still have that file somewhere...


Key concepts (all you need):----------->
Repository (repo): A project tracked by Git
Your python-for-ai folder can be a repository
Staging: Choosing which changes to save
Like selecting items to put in a box before shipping
Commit: A saved snapshot of your code
Like saving in a video game - you can always go back
Push: Upload your commits to GitHub
Backs up your code online
Pull: Download changes from GitHub
Get updates when working with others
Clone: Copy a project from GitHub
How you get AI projects to try






GIT---------->
# 0. First time only - initialize Git in your project
git init

# 1. Save your changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "Add price calculation function"

# 2. Upload to GitHub (after connecting to GitHub - see next pages)
git push

# That's it! Your code is saved and backed up
